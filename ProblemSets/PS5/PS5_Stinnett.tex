\section{Data from Wikipedia}
The data I collected was a table from Wikipedia of all the supreme court cases heard during the Rehnquist court. using this data set as well as the many other similar lists on Wikipedia I would hope to be able to generate some summary statistics on the number of cases that go through the supreme court each year using the year located in the citation variable. I also would like to see what states appear most often in the supreme court using the Case Name variable. I could even divide it up based on what side they where on given whether their name came before or after the "v."

\section{Guides Used}
I used the used a guide on how to scrape an html table using rvest found at: 
https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-rvest-to-scrape-an-html-table/

\section{Data from Yahoo Finance}
for this section I just pulled some data from yahoo finance for the two largest video card manufacturers Nvidia and AMD. I try and keep up with tech news and wanted to see what their recent stock prices looked like. out of curiosity I also looked at how correlated the two stock prices are.
