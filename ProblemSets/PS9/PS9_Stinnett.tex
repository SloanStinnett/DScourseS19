\section{Questions}
Question 1:
What is the optimal value of lambda ? 
0.0504
What is the in-sample RMSE?
0.2051383
What is the out-of-sample RMSE (i.e. the RMSE in the test data)?
0.2502986

Question 2:
What is the optimal value of lambda ? 
0.141
What is the in-sample RMSE?
0.1605712
What is the out-of-sample RMSE (i.e. the RMSE in the test data)?
0.1711735

Question 3:
What is the optimal value of lambda and alpha ? 
lambda=0.0173,alpha=0.0306
What is the in-sample RMSE?
0.1638702
What is the out-of-sample RMSE (i.e. the RMSE in the test data)?
0.1841104

We could not use a simple linear regression as the parameters of the data are not linear. Given the values we can guess that the prediction is somewhere near the center of the bias variance trade off.
