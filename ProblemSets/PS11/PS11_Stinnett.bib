	abstract = {Factual scenario analysis of a judgement is critical to judges during sentencing. With the increasing number of legal cases, professionals typically endure heavy workloads on a daily basis. Although a few previous studies have applied information technology to legal cases, according to our research, no prior studies have predicted a pending judgement using legal documents. In this article, we introduce an innovative solution to predict relevant rulings. The proposed approach employs text mining methods to extract features from precedents and applies a text classifier to automatically classify judgements according to sentiment analysis. This approach can assist legal experts or litigants in predicting possible judgements. Experimental results from a judgement data set reveal that our approach is a satisfactory method for judgement classification.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the application of text classification methods to support law professionals. We present several experiments applying machine learning techniques to predict with high accuracy the ruling of the French Supreme Court and the law area to which a case belongs to. We also investigate the influence of the time period in which a ruling was made on the form of the case description and the extent to which we need to mask information in a full case ruling to automatically obtain training and test data that resembles case descriptions. We developed a mean probability ensemble system combining the output of multiple {SVM} classifiers. We report results of 98\% average F1 score in predicting a case ruling, 96\% F1 score for predicting the law area of a case, and 87.07\% F1 score on estimating the date of a ruling.},
